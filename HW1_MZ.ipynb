       " 'review_text': 'This is a special book. It started slow for about the first third, then in the middle third it started to get interesting, then the last third blew my mind. This is what I love about good science fiction - it pushes your thinking about where things can go. \\n It is a 2015 Hugo winner, and translated from its original Chinese, which made it interesting in just a different way from most things I\\'ve read. For instance the intermixing of Chinese revolutionary history - how they kept accusing people of being \"reactionaries\", etc. \\n It is a book about science, and aliens. The science described in the book is impressive - its a book grounded in physics and pretty accurate as far as I could tell. Though when it got to folding protons into 8 dimensions I think he was just making stuff up - interesting to think about though. \\n But what would happen if our SETI stations received a message - if we found someone was out there - and the person monitoring and answering the signal on our side was disillusioned? That part of the book was a bit dark - I would like to think human reaction to discovering alien civilization that is hostile would be more like Enders Game where we would band together. \\n I did like how the book unveiled the Trisolaran culture through the game. It was a smart way to build empathy with them and also understand what they\\'ve gone through across so many centuries. And who know a 3 body problem was an unsolvable math problem? But I still don\\'t get who made the game - maybe that will come in the next book. \\n I loved this quote: \\n \"In the long history of scientific progress, how many protons have been smashed apart in accelerators by physicists? How many neutrons and electrons? Probably no fewer than a hundred million. Every collision was probably the end of the civilizations and intelligences in a microcosmos. In fact, even in nature, the destruction of universes must be happening at every second--for example, through the decay of neutrons. Also, a high-energy cosmic ray entering the atmosphere may destroy thousands of such miniature universes....\"',\n",
